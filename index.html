                <p>James Bond (007) is a British Secret Service agent created
                    in
                    1953 by Ian Fleming. Over the years, there have been more
                    than
                    20 movies with different famous actors portrayed the
                    British
                    agent. As a fan of the series, I want to look at the data
                    to
                    explore some interesting ideas.</p>

                <p>I am going to work on the “James Bond Movie Dataset” from <a
                        href="https://www.kaggle.com/dreb87/jamesbond">Kaggle</a>.
                    This dataset includes information about 24 James Bond
                    movies
                    from 1962 to 2015.

                <p>There are 27 columns in the dataset. Let’s cleanup and
                    select
                    the columns that are related to our exploratory

                <h2 id="audience-acceptance">Audience Acceptance</h2>

                <p>The first thing I want to do with this dataset is to see
                    what
                    the audience thinks of Bond movies over the years. Since
                    the
                    first release in 1962 to 2015, how has the rating changed?
                    The
                    dataset provides rating of each movie from IMDB and Rotten
                    Tomatoes. Combine these 2 metrics, I can find the average
                    rating of each movie.

                </p>
                <img src="/images/rating_data.png" alt="" />
                <p>Plotting a line graph to see the trend of rating over the
                    year:
                </p>

                <p><img src="/images/rating.png" alt="" /></p>

                <p>Looking at the graph, the series has a good start in the 60s
                    with consistent rating over 7.5. However, it trends down in
                    next 2 decades. The 80s witnesses the downfall of Bond,
                    with
                    rating dips below 5.5 at the lowest. Things start to look
                    up
                    for Bond since 2000s. The rating for the series fluctuates
                    over
                    the years. One of the main contributing factors is who
                    plays
                    Bond, which bring us to the next point in this analysis.
                </p>

                <h2 id="who-is-the-best-bond">Who is the best Bond?</h2>

                <p>There have been 6 changes of actor. To get an average score
                    for
                    each actor, I take all the movies with the same actor and
                    calculate the mean rating.</p>

                <p><img src="/images/bond_rate.png" alt="" /></p>

                <p>With his class and charisma, there is no surprise that Sean
                    Connery is rated the best Bond. Even though Daniel Craig is
                    in
                    second place, his rating is so close to Connery that the
                    two
                    can be considered as tie. Interestingly, Connery is the
                    first
                    actor to play Bond (1962) and Craig is the lasted one
                    starting
                    from 2006.</p>

                <h2 id="commercial-success">Commercial Success</h2>

                <p>The James Bond series has been a familiar name at the
                    worldwide
                    box office. By looking the gross earning of all the movie,
                    we
                    can easily see which movie has the highest revenue.
                    However,
                    just looking at the revenue doesn’t give us the full
                    picture.
                    I’m also curious about the return on investment of each
                    movie,
                    in other word, the ratio between Budget and Revenue.</p>

                <p><img src="/images/revenue.png" alt="" /></p>

                <p>2012’s “Skyfall” with Daniel Craig is the most commercially
                    successful Bond film of all time, with over $1.1 billion at
                    the
                    worldwide box office. At second place is 1965’s
                    “Thunderball”
                    with Sean Connery.</p>

                <p><img src="/images/ratio.png" alt="" /></p>

                <p>Looking at the Budget/Revenue ratio metric, “Dr.No” is
                    unbeatable with a ratio of almost 60. This is an incredible
                    return on investment. Second place on this list is 1964’s
                    “Goldfinger.”</p>

                <h2 id="locations">Locations</h2>

                <p>As a secret agent with a mission to save the world, Bond has
                    been to many exotic destinations, from snowy mountains in
                    Switzerland to deserts in Chile. Using the Shooting
                    location
                    provided in the dataset, I calculated the frequency each
                    country appears in the series. I then plotted a choropleth
                    map
                    to visualize where Bond has been:</p>

                <p><img src="/images/map.png" alt="" /></p>

                <p>Looking at the distribution on the map, England is on top of
                    the
                    list with 20 appearances over 24 movies. No surprise there
                    since this is where Bond calls home. US, France and Italy
                    are
                    among the top locations chosen for Bond movies. Switzerland
                    and
                    Spain also appear in a few movies. It’ll be interesting to
                    see
                    where Bond’s next mission will take him.</p>
